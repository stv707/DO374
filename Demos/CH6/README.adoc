.Cgroups and Profiling

The *create_cgroup.txt* command allows the creation of a CGROUP and running of the playbook for profiling. Currently we are using the *ansible-playbook* command to profile and run CGROUPS. This means all collections and components need to be installed on the controller node to run.

Playbook names help describe what is happening.
